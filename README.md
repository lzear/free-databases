### Dead providers or broken demos

* Bit.io is discontinued
* CosmosDB stopped working after 2 weeks
* ElephantSQL will be discontinued in 2025
* Railway required an update from me (which I might do later)

## Getting started locally

Run `yarn install`, then `yarn dev`.

To make the different databases work locally, you will need to create accounts
with the third parties and add your credentials in your `.env`.

You will also need to create the todos table:

```sql
-- PostgreSQL table for most providers
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "todos" (
	"id" text PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
	"created_at" timestamp DEFAULT now() NOT NULL,
	"updated_at" timestamp DEFAULT now() NOT NULL,
	"name" text NOT NULL,
	"done" boolean NOT NULL
);

-- MySQL table for PlanetScale
CREATE TABLE `Todo` (
	`id` varchar(191) NOT NULL,
	`createdAt` datetime(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT current_timestamp(3),
	`updatedAt` datetime(3) NOT NULL,
	`name` text NOT NULL,
	`done` tinyint(1) NOT NULL,
	PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
	UNIQUE KEY `Todo_id_key` (`id`)
) ENGINE InnoDB,
  CHARSET utf8mb4,
  COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

## Test

* Unit tests: `yarn test`
* Cypress tests: `yarn e2e`

## Thanks

* All the providers for providing free tiers
* Vercel too, also for the generous free tier

## Known issues / be aware / miscellaneous

* Took a shortcut and set `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0`, which is probably not something that you should do in
  production.
* ~~For Fly.io, I am allocating to database to an IPv4 address, which costs $2/month. I could not find a way to use the
  free IPv6 address with NextJS+Vercel.~~ Fly.io never charged me, so I guess it's free.
* Using Next.js app directory, I couldn't find a way to nicely define special `export const dynamic = '...'`
  or `export const fetchCache = '...'`. It forced me to copy some folders (`convex`, `cookie`, `deta`), it would be nice
  if this could be avoided.
* Databases descriptions are taken from any place I could find them or AI-generated, they might not be very accurate.
